# Solidity101-FundMe
Our FundMe contract is a perfect example of a crowdfunded project. Think of it as your very own decentralized Kickstarter, where users can send any native blockchain cryptocurrency. It allows the owner of the contract to withdraw all the funds collected for their new project. It is designed so that it can be deployed on a testnet.
